# AI Exam Evaluator: Built with Kiro - Video Script (90 seconds)

## Opening Hook (0-15 seconds)
**[Screen: Split view showing complex exam papers and AI evaluation results]**

**Narrator (energetic):** "What if you could build an AI-powered exam evaluator that processes thousands of student papers with the precision of a master teacher? Meet the AI Exam Evaluator - built entirely with Kiro's intelligent assistance."

## The Challenge & Vision (15-30 seconds)
**[Screen: Developer at computer, showing initial conversation with Kiro]**

**Narrator:** "Our developer started with a simple conversation: 'Kiro, help me build an AI system that can evaluate IELTS, O-Level, and IGCSE exam papers.' What followed was pure magic."

**[Screen: Shows Kiro conversation snippets]**
- "Structure this as a React TypeScript app with Supabase backend"
- "Integrate Google Gemini AI for intelligent evaluation"
- "Add PDF processing with security features"

## Spec-Driven Development (30-50 seconds)
**[Screen: Shows .kiro/specs folder structure and automated-feedback-generation spec]**

**Narrator:** "The breakthrough came with Kiro's spec-driven approach. Instead of scattered conversations, we created structured specifications that Kiro transformed into production-ready code."

**[Screen: Shows spec requirements converting to actual components]**

**Developer Voice-over:** "I'd write: 'Create an evaluation service that handles PDF parsing, AI integration, and result management' - and Kiro would generate complete TypeScript services with error handling, type safety, and security built-in."

## Impressive Code Generation (50-70 seconds)
**[Screen: Shows complex code being generated - useExamEvaluator hook, evaluationService.ts]**

**Narrator:** "The most impressive moment? When Kiro generated a complete state management system with custom hooks, error boundaries, and draft recovery - over 500 lines of production-ready code in minutes."

**[Screen: Shows test files being auto-generated]**

**Developer Voice-over:** "Kiro didn't just write the code - it generated comprehensive test suites, security configurations, and even deployment scripts. The testing coverage hit 85% automatically."

## Agent Hooks Automation (70-85 seconds)
**[Screen: Shows automated workflows in action]**

**Narrator:** "But here's where it gets revolutionary - Kiro's agent hooks automated our entire development workflow. Every time we saved a component, hooks automatically updated tests, checked security compliance, and optimized performance."

**[Screen: Shows real-time code updates and test execution]**

**Developer Voice-over:** "The hooks transformed development from reactive to proactive. Code quality became automatic, not accidental."

## Closing Impact (85-90 seconds)
**[Screen: Final application running - students uploading papers, AI evaluating, results displaying]**

**Narrator:** "The result? A production-ready AI exam evaluator serving thousands of students, built in record time with enterprise-grade security and performance. This is the future of development - this is building with Kiro."
