# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The User Authentication System provides secure access control for the AI Exam Evaluator application, supporting multiple user roles with appropriate permissions and access levels. The system leverages Supabase authentication services to provide robust security features including multi-factor authentication, role-based access control, and comprehensive user management capabilities for teachers, students, and administrators.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to create an account and log in securely, so that I can access the exam evaluation features and manage my students' assessments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN registering THEN the system SHALL require email, password, and professional verification
2. WHEN logging in THEN the system SHALL authenticate using email and password with optional MFA
3. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL redirect to the appropriate dashboard based on user role
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and account recovery options
5. WHEN logged in THEN the system SHALL maintain session security with automatic timeout

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want to access my evaluation results through a secure login, so that I can view my exam performance and feedback privately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN students register THEN the system SHALL require student ID verification and institutional email
2. WHEN students log in THEN the system SHALL provide access only to their own evaluation results
3. WHEN viewing results THEN the system SHALL log access for audit purposes
4. IF student credentials are compromised THEN the system SHALL provide immediate password reset capabilities
5. WHEN accessing results THEN the system SHALL enforce data privacy and prevent unauthorized sharing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage user accounts and permissions, so that I can control access to the system and maintain security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing users THEN the system SHALL provide admin interface for user creation, modification, and deactivation
2. WHEN assigning roles THEN the system SHALL support teacher, student, and admin role assignments
3. WHEN monitoring access THEN the system SHALL provide audit logs of all authentication and authorization events
4. IF security issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide tools to suspend accounts and investigate breaches
5. WHEN configuring security THEN the system SHALL allow setting password policies and MFA requirements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to recover my account if I forget my password or lose access, so that I can regain access to my evaluation data without losing my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting password reset THEN the system SHALL send secure reset links to verified email addresses
2. WHEN resetting password THEN the system SHALL enforce strong password requirements and prevent reuse
3. WHEN account is locked THEN the system SHALL provide multiple recovery options including admin assistance
4. IF MFA device is lost THEN the system SHALL provide backup recovery codes and admin override options
5. WHEN recovery is completed THEN the system SHALL notify user of successful account restoration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious institution, I want the system to enforce strong authentication policies, so that sensitive educational data remains protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users create passwords THEN the system SHALL enforce minimum complexity requirements
2. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically lock accounts and notify administrators
3. WHEN users access the system THEN the system SHALL log all authentication attempts with IP addresses and timestamps
4. IF multiple failed login attempts occur THEN the system SHALL implement progressive delays and account lockouts
5. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL encrypt all authentication tokens and session data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to manage my students' access to evaluation results, so that I can control when and how students receive their feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluations are completed THEN the system SHALL allow teachers to control result visibility to students
2. WHEN managing student access THEN the system SHALL provide bulk operations for class-wide permission changes
3. WHEN students are added THEN the system SHALL allow teachers to invite students and manage their enrollment
4. IF students need access revoked THEN the system SHALL provide immediate access suspension capabilities
5. WHEN permissions change THEN the system SHALL notify affected students of access status updates
